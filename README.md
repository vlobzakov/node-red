# Node-RED Development Environment  
 
Prepackaged [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) IoT programming tool for connecting online services, hardware devices and APIs through an interactive browser-based editor.
 
## One-Click Node-RED Package Specifics
 
Providing ready-to-go Node-RED development environment, the current solution has the following implementation specifics:
 
- based on [nodered/node-red-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red-docker/) Docker image with the _latest_ tag as a solution base
- created Node-RED instance is assigned *16 dynamic cloudlets*, which enable it to [scale out](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-vertical-scaling) up to 2 GiB of RAM and 6.4 GHz of CPU
- automatically attached [endpoint](https://docs.jelastic.com/endpoints) allows to access your Node-RED admin panel through a randomly allocated [Shared Load Balancer](https://docs.jelastic.com/shared-load-balancer) port, eliminating the necessity to purchase Public IP address
